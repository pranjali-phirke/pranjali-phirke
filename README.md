Hi, I’m Pranjali Phirke, 
an AWS Certified Solutions Architect with experience in DevOps practices.

I specialize in Cloud Infrastructure, Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), and Automation.
Currently, I’m focused on expanding my expertise in Kubernetes orchestration, serverless architectures, and advanced automation.
I’m eager to collaborate on cloud-native projects, infrastructure as code (Terraform, AWS), and optimizing CI/CD pipelines.
